==== NAME ====

    URI::Encode - Simple URI Encoding/Decoding


==== VERSION ====

    This document describes URI::Encode version 0.03


==== SYNOPSIS ====

            ## OO Interface
            use URI::Encode;
            my $uri = URI::Encode->new();
            my $encoded = $uri->encode($url);
            my $decoded = $uri->decode($encoded);

            ## Using exported functions
            use URI::Encode qw(uri_encode uri_decode);
            my $encoded = uri_encode($url);
            my $decoded = uri_decode($url);


==== DESCRIPTION ====

    This modules provides simple URI (Percent) encoding/decoding. This
    module borrows from URI::Escape, but 'tinier'


==== METHODS ====


==   new()   ==

    Creates a new object, no argumetns are required

            my $encoder = URI::Encode->new();


==   encode($url, $including_reserved)   ==

    This method encodes the URL provided. The method does not encode any
    "Reserved Characters" unless $including_reserved is true. The $url
    provided is first converted into UTF-8 before percent encoding.

            $uri->encode("http://perl.com/foo bar");      # http://perl.com/foo%20bar
            $uri->encode("http://perl.com/foo bar", 1);   # http%3A%2F%2Fperl.com%2Ffoo%20bar


==   decode($url)   ==

    This method decodes a 'percent' encoded URL. If you had encoded the URL
    using this module (or any other method), chances are that the URL was
    converted to UTF-8 before 'percent' encoding. Be sure to check the
    format and convert back if required.

            $uri->decode("http%3A%2F%2Fperl.com%2Ffoo%20bar"); # "http://perl.com/foo bar"


==== EXPORTED FUNCTIONS ====

    The following functions are exported upon request. This provides a
    non-OOP interface


==   uri_encode($url, $including_reserved)   ==

    See "encode($url, $including_reserved)"


==   uri_decode($url)   ==

    See "decode($url)"


==== CHARACTER CLASSES ====


==   Reserved Characters   ==

    The following characters are considered as reserved (RFC 3986
    <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>). They will be encoded only if
    requested.

             ! * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ? % # [ ]


==   Unreserved Characters   ==

    The following characters are considered as Unreserved. They will not be
    encoded

            a-z
            A-Z
            0-9
            - _ . ~
