  # NAME

  URI::Encode - Simple percent
  Encoding/Decoding

  # SYNOPSIS

  # OOP Interface use URI::Encode; my
  $uri =
  URI::Encode->new({encode_reserved =>
  0}); my $encoded = uri->encode(data);
  my $decoded = uri->decode(encoded);

  # Functional use URI::Encode
  qw(uri_encode uri_decode); my
  encoded = uri_encode(data); my
  decoded = uri_decode(encoded);

  # DESCRIPTION

  This modules provides simple URI
  (Percent) encoding/decoding

  The main purpose of this module (at
  least for me) was to provide an easy
  method to encode strings (mainly
  URLs) into a format which can be
  pasted into a plain text emails, and
  that those links are 'click-able' by
  the person reading that email. This
  can be accomplished by NOT encoding
  the reserved characters.

  If you are looking for speed and want
  to encode reserved characters, use
  URI::Escape::XS

  # METHODS

  ## new()

  Creates a new object, no arguments
  are required

  my $encoder =
  URI::Encode->new(%options);

  The following options can be passed
  to the constructor

  - encode_reserved

  my $encoder =
  URI::Encode->new({encode_reserved =>
  0});

  If true, "Reserved Characters" are
  also encoded. Defaults to false.

  ## encode($url, $including_reserved)

  This method encodes the URL provided.
  The method does not encode any
  "Reserved Characters" unless
  $including_reserved is true or set in
  the constructor. The $url provided is
  first converted into UTF-8 before
  percent encoding.

  $uri->encode("http://perl.com/foo
  bar"); # http://perl.com/foo%20bar
  $uri->encode("http://perl.com/foo
  bar", 1); #
  http%3A%2F%2Fperl.com%2Ffoo%20bar

  ## decode($url)

  This method decodes a 'percent'
  encoded URL. If you had encoded the
  URL using this module (or any other
  method), chances are that the URL was
  converted to UTF-8 before 'percent'
  encoding. Be sure to check the format
  and convert back if required.

  $uri->decode("http%3A%2F%2Fperl.com%2
  Ffoo%20bar");
  # "http://perl.com/foo bar"

  # EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

  The following functions are exported
  upon request. This provides a non-OOP
  interface

  ## uri_encode($url,
  $including_reserved)

  See ["encode($url,
  including_reserved)"](#encode(url,
  $including_reserved))

  ## uri_decode($url)

  See ["decode(url)"](#decode(url))

  # CHARACTER CLASSES

  ## Reserved Characters

  The following characters are
  considered as reserved (RFC 3986).
  They will be encoded only if
  requested.

  ! * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ? % # [ ]

  ## Unreserved Characters

  considered as Unreserved. They will
  not be encoded

  a-z A-Z 0-9 - _ . ~
